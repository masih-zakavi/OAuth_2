### This repo contains app for authentication through Google SSO for a generic database ###

Simply run app.py and open localhost:8084 in your browser. Any user is allowed to leave comments but only admin users can add, delete, update admins. Before doing this, OAuth 2 authentication needs to be completed through Google.
